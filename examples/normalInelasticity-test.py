# Script to test the constitutive law contained in NormalInelasticityLaw : consider two spheres moving one to each other (this script illustrates few different ways of moving spheres)
#- first penetration of the contact evolves => Monitor of the normal force
#- then, test in tangential direction
#- finally for what concerns moment transfer, with relative orientation changes (use frictionAngle=0.0 in this case to study more easily what's going on)

#Different graphs illustrate the effects of the different loadings. The run is paused at each plot window (so that there is time to observe them). Push on "Return", while being in the Yade terminal, to go ahead.

# Comment/uncomment around l.18-19 and l.38 to execute the script with Law2_ScGeom_FrictPhys_CundallStrack, to see the difference

#No crash warranty with r2676 and r2852 +/-2

# - different unTrue and unPerso illustrate the definition of penetrationDepth really used in the code (computed in Ig2_Sphere_Sphere_ScGeom6D) which is slightly different from R1 + R2 - Distance (because of this "shift2" in Distance computation). According to the really used penetrationDepth, Fn evolves as it should
# - value of virgin slope is 4e9 N/m (r2851) corresponding indeed to input "young" (as it should be the case here with used radii)
# - and unload-reload slope is correctly multiplied by three

# - evolution of Fx with gamma normal (flat at the beginning because of the order of engines)
# - waited value of initial slope of fx(gamma) equal to 1.6 e8 N/m confirmed by what can be measured (r2851)
# - un decreases indeed during this shear, but maybe a zoom on the curves is needed to see it.
# - We can observe that the force state of the sample decreases a line with a slope equal to tan(~34.5Â°)=tan(~0.602 rad). Why not strict equality ? Because of the measure of the slope or because something else ? To see...
# - during this phase O.forces.t(0).norm() / O.forces.f(0)[0] seems to increase between 0.502 and 0.507 (according to r=[T[i]/F[i] for i in range(50,T.__len__()-20) ])
#	Please note, to explain this, that Fx = O.forces.f(0)[0] is more and more different from Ft, from which we can expect Ft = Torque /Radius
